Ughh... I finally arrived...
Natsu is bad with vehicles, huh?
Well, this time I'll support you,
so do your best!
Agh... I feel sick... 
Aye!
Alright then, let's get started
I'll teach you how to move.
Use the analog stick to move in the desired direction.
Press it to move.
Also, press the X button to jump.
While moving, you can do a forward roll with the R button, so use it well.
Got it!
Let's explore the town.
Eh!?
Are you a mage from Fairy Tail?
Fairy Tail?
Yeah, I'm the Salamander of Fairy Tail.
Haven't heard of it?
Yes!
Hehe... You.
You want to join Fairy Tail?
If you join my ship party,
I'll talk to the master for you.
Haha, it looks like it'll be a great party.
You have such an easygoing personality...
Natsu.
......
Welcome to our pirate ship!
I'll keep you quiet... Miss.
What?!
What do you mean?
Didn't you say you'd let me join Fairy Tail!?
Hmph!
You idiot!
You're up for sale now!!
So, you're a mage of Fairy Tail...?
You're the worst mage ever!!
What?
Nothing!
Ugh... No good, I still can't handle vehicles...
So lame!
Hey hey, ge!
A cat talked!
We'll discuss the details later, for now, cooperate and fight.
Alright, got it!
I'm leaving now!
...No good... Totally can't...
Ugh!
Why are you here!
Right!
It's the sea outside... Alright!
Leave it to me!!
Let's go!
Open the door to the Treasure Bottle Palace!
I shall open the door.
Aquarius!
Aquarius!
What?!
Hey!
Isn't it amazing!
Even so, I'm a Star Spirit Mage.
Hey, don't call me for a while.
I'm going on a trip with my boyfriend for a week.
With my boyfriend!
Don't say it twice!
Alright, the shaking has... stopped.
...Damn.
Are you a mage from Fairy Tail?
Then what!
I'm Natsu of Fairy Tail!
I've never seen someone like you!
Fairy Tail!?
Of Fairy Tail?!?
You're a mage from Fairy Tail?
Whether you're a villain or a good person,
I don't care,
but I won't allow you to impersonate Fairy Tail.
Come at me from anywhere!
Kid!
What is this commotion!
Yabe!!
I won't run away!
Why are you involving me!
Because you want to join our guild, right?
Do it!
Come!
Yes!
Fairy Tail.
Wow... It's so big.
Welcome to Fairy Tail!
I wonder if they'll let me join...
I'm getting nervous...
I'm home!
Wait, what?
There aren't many people today.
Oh, welcome back.
Good job solving the bandit incident.
There aren't many people, though.
Did something happen?
After you went on the quest,
we received many large monster extermination requests.
And everyone went away.
More importantly,
the master is furious because the port was half-destroyed.
Honestly, you guys...
Causing trouble everywhere you go!
I'm always getting scolded by the councilors!
(This person is the master...)
But...
Fuck the councilors!
Huh?
If you worry about the higher-ups, magic won't progress.
Don't fear the stupid councilors!
Follow the path you believe in!
That's what a Fairy Tail mage is!
Hahaha!
As expected of grandpa!
Indeed... By the way, miss, who are you?
Ah, um!
I'm Lucy, a Star Spirit Mage!
I was caught by the bandits, so I was saved.
I want to join Fairy Tail~
Hmm...
C-Can’t I...?
Sure~ Nice to meet you!
Thank you so much!!
That was easy!!
Lucy has
become usable.
I got to join Fairy Tail,
found a good room,
so I'll rest today
and work hard from tomorrow!
Yo!
Welcome back!!
Welcome~
Why are you guys here!!
Don't worry about the details.
I do care!!
By the way, it's a nice room.
I'll use it sometimes.
What about my privacy!!
Isn't it fine?
We're comrades after all.
Even among close friends, there's etiquette!!
Don't you know that?
Go home already!!!
There's nothing to be so angry about, right?
Lucy is so quick to anger.
Well, whatever.
Let's hang out again.
Lucy's room
A new quest has
been added.
Before entering battle,
I'll explain the attack methods.
Alright!
Please do.
Press the □ button
to perform a normal attack.
Additionally, while doing a normal attack, press the □ button again
to perform an extra attack.
Also, the △ button
allows you to do an upward attack.
When you hit and lift the enemy,
try to aim for a combo attack.
Finally, the ○ button
lets you perform a magic attack,
but magic attacks consume mana,
so be careful.
Got it!
Also, when you land attacks,
the Voltage Gauge fills up.
When the gauge is full,
press △ and L buttons together
to enter an awakened state,
boosting your parameters for a set time.
Is that so!
Also, pressing ○ and △ together
allows you to use Unison Raid.
What's that?
It's a very powerful combination magic.
Using Unison Raid
can deal massive damage to enemies!!
Alright then, Natsu!
Those guys,
let's defeat them quickly!
Well...
Even if you tell me to find the thieves...
Where should I go!
In a case where a girl goes missing,
if the culprit is a thief, the port is suspicious.
I see, alright!
Then,
let's first go to the port!
Before going to the port,
you can move by inputting the commands.
Alright then!
Let's go to the port.
Eh!?
You're from Fairy Tail...
Hey, that's spot on.
Hehehe!
Let's do this.
Alright, let's catch them...
Wait a bit~
A group of thieves, right?
Let's join the party~
Joining the party to capture all the thieves at once isn't bad...
Alright, let's go!
Welcome!
To our ship party.
Ufufufu, once this party ends,
I can join Fairy Tail too~
Yeah, of course.
Wait a minute!
Eh!?
What?!
I never invited you guys!
Get someone to take these guys out!
Hmph!
If they're your comrades, they're resting leisurely in the plaza!
Who are you!
I am
Gray of Fairy Tail!
Still, you...
How do you plan to
invite us to Fairy Tail on this ship?
Huh?
Hey!
What do you mean?
B-Bora-san...
Some weird guy got on the ship...
Idiot!
Don't call me by that name!!
Bora of Prominence...
He was expelled from a mage guild called Titannose a few years ago.
Hmph!
He's trash!
What the!!
I'll show you my power!
Oh, I'm looking forward to that.
Hey hey...!?
A cat talked!
It's now or never, let's run.
No way!
I will never allow you to toy with this maiden's pure heart!
A maiden's pure heart?
I'm not falling for that!
What!?
Hey, who are you calling a maiden?
So don't fall for it!
Acting high and mighty,
following a guy like that
is why you can't get a boyfriend. Mind your own business!!
Ugh...
At just a little more...
Come on, let's settle this quickly.
Hmph!
Don't underestimate me, kid!!
Now this case is closed.
Hey!
What is this fuss!! Ge, did you go too far?
Happy, let's withdraw.
Wait a bit!
Take me with you too!?
Ah, it's the girl from earlier.
If this continues,
I'll be the culprit!
But destroying the port was the Star Spirit...
Shut up, you cat!!
Huh?
What a troublesome woman.
Come to think of it, she said she wanted to join Fairy Tail, so it's fine, right?
Just do whatever you want. Yay~
I'm Lucy.
This is Happy, and this is Gray.
They're here!
Oh no!
Let's go!
Yeah, I'm tired.
There aren't many people today.
There aren't any, though.
Did something happen?
As expected of grandpa!
He saved me when the bandits were about to catch us.
Now the rent of 70k is cheap.
Is there a problem?
Yes!!
From now on, we're in the same guild.
Let's get along.
Don't worry about it.
There's nothing to be so angry about, right?
Well, let's use it again. Oops!
What are you guys
Doing?
Only authorized personnel can enter beyond here.
Wow... We got caught.
See, if you don't leave quickly,
you'll get hurt.
Huh?
Who are you talking to?
If you can do it, try me!
What's that?
Alright then, Gray!
Oh, you guys came at just the right time.  
Leave it to me!  
I can handle anything on land!  
Let's finish this quickly.  
Ugh, my stomach hurts again.  
Natsu, pull yourself together!  
Alright! We’re done here.  
That was too easy.  
I’m starting to get fired up!  
Good grief, what a show-off.  
We’re heading back now!  
Let’s move!  
Returning to the guild...  
Oh! You’re back!  
Welcome back, everyone!  
Thanks for your hard work.  
Hey! What's with that expression?  
What’s wrong with how I look?!  
Lucy, let’s have a toast to welcome you to Fairy Tail!  
Huh? Right now?  
Cheers!  
Let’s work hard together!  
...Cheers!  
Lucy, don’t look so nervous.  
I’m not nervous!  
You’ve got the Fairy Tail spirit now, right?  
Yeah... I think so.  
Well, good luck, Lucy!  
Thanks! I’ll do my best.  
By the way, about that monster request earlier...  
What about it?  
It’s been taken care of already.  
Huh? By who?  
Gray and Erza took care of it.  
That’s great!  
They sure are amazing.  
I’ve got a long way to go.  
Don’t worry, Lucy. You’ll get there!  
Thanks, Happy.  
Now, let’s check the quest board!  
Alright! Time for another adventure!  
Lucy, pick something that’s not too hard.  
Yeah, yeah, I’ll keep it simple.  
How about this one?  
Looks good to me.  
Alright, let’s go!  
Natsu, let’s stay focused this time, okay?  
Hey, I’m always focused!  
Sure you are...  
What’s that supposed to mean?!  
Nothing, nothing! Let’s just go.  

Here’s the spot mentioned in the request.  
It’s quiet... too quiet.  
Be on your guard. Something feels off.  
You’re right. Stay alert, everyone.  

There! I see something moving!  
Let’s approach carefully.  
Got it!  
Whoa, it’s a pack of monsters!  
Here we go! Time to show them what Fairy Tail’s made of!  
Don’t hold back!  

Whew... that was close.  
But we did it!  
Great work, everyone!  
Let’s head back and report to the client.  
Yeah, let’s get our reward!  

Back at the guild:  
Welcome back, you three!  
Thanks, Mirajane.  
How did the quest go?  
Piece of cake!  
Well, mostly...  
Lucy’s getting better every day!  
Stop it, you’re embarrassing me!  

Looks like you’ve settled in nicely, Lucy.  
Yeah, I really feel at home here.  
That’s what Fairy Tail is all about.  
It sure is. Thanks for everything, guys.  
Always, Lucy. Welcome to the family.  

The end.
